Configuration files
===================

An NLP pipeline config is a JSON file that contains one required element ``chainer``:

.. code:: python

    {
      "chainer": {
        "in": ["x"],
        "in_y": ["y"],
        "pipe": [
          ...
        ],
        "out": ["y_predicted"]
      }
    }

:class:`~deeppavlov.core.common.chainer.Chainer` is a core concept of DeepPavlov library: chainer builds a pipeline from
heterogeneous components (Rule-Based/ML/DL) and allows to train or infer from pipeline as a whole. Each component in the
pipeline specifies its inputs and outputs as arrays of names, for example: ``"in": ["tokens", "features"]`` and
``"out": ["token_embeddings", "features_embeddings"]`` and you can chain outputs of one components with inputs of other
components:

.. code:: python

    {
      "class": "deeppavlov.models.preprocessors.str_lower:StrLower",
      "in": ["x"],
      "out": ["x_lower"]
    },
    {
      "name": "nltk_tokenizer",
      "in": ["x_lower"],
      "out": ["x_tokens"]
    },

Each :class:`~deeppavlov.core.models.component.Component` in the pipeline must implement method :meth:`__call__` and has
``name`` parameter, which is its registered codename, or ``class`` parameter in the form of
``module_name:ClassName``. It can also have any other parameters which repeat its :meth:`__init__` method arguments.
Default values of :meth:`__init__` arguments will be overridden with the config values during the initialization of a
class instance.

You can reuse components in the pipeline to process different parts of data with the help of ``id`` and ``ref``
parameters:

.. code:: python

    {
      "name": "nltk_tokenizer",
      "id": "tokenizer",
      "in": ["x_lower"],
      "out": ["x_tokens"]
    },
    {
      "ref": "tokenizer",
      "in": ["y"],
      "out": ["y_tokens"]
    },


Training
--------

There are two abstract classes for trainable components: :class:`~deeppavlov.core.models.estimator.Estimator`
and :class:`~deeppavlov.core.models.nn_model.NNModel`.

:class:`~deeppavlov.core.models.estimator.Estimator` are fit once on any data with no batching or early stopping,
so it can be safely done at the time of pipeline initialization. :meth:`fit` method has to be implemented for each
:class:`~deeppavlov.core.models.estimator.Estimator`. One example is :class:`~deeppavlov.core.data.vocab.Vocab`.

:class:`~deeppavlov.core.models.nn_model.NNModel` requires more complex training. It can only be trained in a supervised
mode (as opposed to :class:`~deeppavlov.core.models.estimator.Estimator` which can be trained in both supervised and
unsupervised settings). This process takes multiple epochs with periodic validation and logging.
:meth:`~deeppavlov.core.models.nn_model.NNModel.train_on_batch` method has to be implemented for each
:class:`~deeppavlov.core.models.nn_model.NNModel`.

Training is triggered by :func:`~deeppavlov.core.commands.train.train_model_from_config` function.


Train config
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:class:`~deeppavlov.core.models.estimator.Estimator` s that are trained should also have ``fit_on`` parameter which
contains a list of input parameter names. An :class:`~deeppavlov.core.models.nn_model.NNModel` should have the ``in_y``
parameter which contains a list of ground truth answer names. For example:

.. code:: python

    [
      {
        "id": "classes_vocab",
        "name": "default_vocab",
        "fit_on": ["y"],
        "level": "token",
        "save_path": "vocabs/classes.dict",
        "load_path": "vocabs/classes.dict"
      },
      {
        "in": ["x"],
        "in_y": ["y"],
        "out": ["y_predicted"],
        "name": "intent_model",
        "save_path": "intents/intent_cnn",
        "load_path": "intents/intent_cnn",
        "classes_vocab": {
          "ref": "classes_vocab"
        }
      }
    ]

The config for training the pipeline should have three additional elements: ``dataset_reader``, ``dataset_iterator``
and ``train``:

.. code:: python

    {
      "dataset_reader": {
        "name": ...,
        ...
      }
      "dataset_iterator": {
        "name": ...,
        ...
      },
      "chainer": {
        ...
      }
      "train": {
        ...
      }
    }


Simplified version of training pipeline contains two elements: ``dataset`` and ``train``. The ``dataset`` element
currently can be used for train from classification data in ``csv`` and ``json`` formats. You can find complete examples
of how to use simplified training pipeline in
:download:`intents_sample_csv.json <../../deeppavlov/configs/intents/intents_sample_csv.json>` and
:download:`intents_sample_json.json <../../deeppavlov/configs/intents/intents_sample_json.json>` config files.


Train Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``epochs`` — maximum number of epochs to train NNModel, defaults to   ``-1`` (infinite)
-  ``batch_size``,
-  ``metrics`` — list of names of registered :mod:`~deeppavlov.metrics` to evaluate the model. The first metric in
   the list is used for early stopping
-  ``metric_optimization`` — ``maximize`` or ``minimize`` a metric, defaults to ``maximize``
-  ``validation_patience`` — how many times in a row the validation metric has to not improve for early stopping,
   defaults to ``5``
-  ``val_every_n_epochs`` — how often to validate the pipe, defaults to ``-1`` (never)
-  ``log_every_n_batches``, ``log_every_n_epochs`` — how often to calculate metrics for train data, defaults to ``-1``
   (never)
-  ``validate_best``, ``test_best`` flags to infer the best saved model on valid and test data, defaults to ``true``


DatasetReader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:class:`~deeppavlov.core.dara.dataset_reader.DatasetReader` class reads data and returns it in a specified format.
A concrete :class:`DatasetReader` class should be inherited from this base class and registered with a codename:


.. code:: python

    from deeppavlov.core.common.registry import register
    from deeppavlov.core.data.dataset_reader import DatasetReader

    @register('dstc2_datasetreader')
    class DSTC2DatasetReader(DatasetReader):


DataLearningIterator and DataFittingIterator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:class:`~deeppavlov.core.data.data_learning_iterator.DataLearningIterator` forms the sets of data ('train', 'valid',
'test') needed for training/inference and divides them into batches. A concrete :class:`DataLearningIterator` class
should be registered and can be inherited from :class:`deeppavlov.data.data_learning_iterator.DataLearningIterator`
class. This is a base class and can be used as a :class:`DataLearningIterator` as well.

:class:`~deeppavlov.core.data.data_fitting_iterator.DataFittingIterator` iterates over provided dataset without
train/valid/test splitting and is useful for :class:`~deeppavlov.core.models.estimator.Estimator` s that do not require
training.


Inference
---------

All components inherited from :class:`~deeppavlov.core.models.component.Component` abstract class can be used for
inference. The :meth:`__call__` method should return standard output of a component. For example, a `tokenizer`
should return `tokens`, a `NER recognizer` should return `recognized entities`, a `bot` should return an `utterance`.
A particular format of returned data should be defined in :meth:`__call__`.

Inference is triggered by :func:`~deeppavlov.core.commands.infer.interact_model` function. There is no need in a
separate JSON for inference.
