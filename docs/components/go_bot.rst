Dialogue Bot for goal-oriented task
===================================

The dialogue bot is based on `[1] <#references>`__ which introduces
Hybrid Code Networks (HCNs) that combine an RNN with domain-specific
knowledge and system action templates.

|alt text| **Diagram 1.** Dotted lines correspond to unrequired
(optional) modules, black squares to trained models, trapezes are
modules that depend on a dataset and must be provided by software
developer.

Here is a simple example of interaction with a trained dialogue bot (can
be downloaded with ``deeppavlov/download.py``):

3. (*optional*) downloaded english fasttext embeddings trained on wiki
   (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fasttext-vectors/wiki.en.zip)\: fasttext embeddings can be loaded via
   ``python3 deeppavlov/download.py -all`` you can use any english embeddings of your choice, but edit go\_bot config
   accordingly.

**TO INFER** from a go\_bot model you should **additionaly** have:

4. pretrained vocabulary of dataset utterance tokens

-  it is trained in the same config as go\_bot model

5. pretrained goal-oriented bot model itself

-  config ``deeppavlov/configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2.json`` is recommended
-  ``slot_filler`` section of go\_bot's config should match NER's configuration

For a working exemplary config see ``deeeppavlov/configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2.json`` (model without embeddings).

A minimal model without ``slot_filler``, ``intent_classifier`` and ``embedder`` is configured
in ``deeeppavlov/configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2_minimal.json``.

A full model (with fasttext embeddings) configuration is in ``deeeppavlov/configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2_all.json``.

configured in ``deeeppavlov/configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2_best.json``.

Usage example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Available **pretrained for DSTC2 dataset** models:

-  model for ``deeppavlov/configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2.json``
-  model for ``deeppavlov/configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2_best.json``

To use pretrained model you should firstly **download it** (if you haven't done it already
by ``python3 deeppavlov/download.py -all``):

.. code:: bash

    cd deeppavlov
    python3 deep.py interact path/to/config.json -d

To infer from a pretrained model with config path equal to ``path/to/config.json``:

.. code:: python

    from deeppavlov.core.commands.infer import build_model_from_config
    from deeppavlov.core.common.file import read_json

    CONFIG_PATH = 'path/to/config.json'
    model = build_model_from_config(read_json(CONFIG_PATH))

    utterance = ""
    while utterance != 'exit':
        print(">> " + model([utterance])[0])
        utterance = input(':: ')

To interact via command line use ``deeppavlov/deep.py`` script:

.. code:: bash

    cd deeppavlov
    python3 deep.py interact path/to/config.json

Training
--------

To train model with config path ``path/to/config.json`` you should firstly **download** all the needed data
(if you haven't done it already by ``python3 deeppavlov/download.py -all``):

.. code:: bash

    cd deeppavlov
    python3 deep.py train path/to/config.json -d

The script will download needed data (dataset, embeddings) for the particular model.

Config parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To be used for training, your config json file should include parameters:

-  ``dataset_reader``
-  ``name`` — ``"your_reader_here"`` for a custom dataset or ``"dstc2_v2_reader"`` to use DSTC2 (for implementation
   see ``deeppavlov.dataset_readers.dstc2_reader``)
-  ``data_path`` — a path to a dataset file, which in case of ``"dstc2_v2_reader"`` will be automatically downloaded
   from internet and placed to ``data_path`` directory
-  ``dataset_iterator`` — it should always be set to ``{"name": "dialog_iterator"}`` (for implementation
   see ``deeppavlov.dataset_iterators.dialog_iterator.py``)

See ``deeeppavlov/configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2.json`` for details.

Train run
^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to run the training is by using ``deeppavlov/deep.py`` script:

.. code:: bash

    cd deeppavlov
    python3 deep.py train path/to/config.json

Datasets
--------

DSTC2
^^^^^

The Hybrid Code Network model was trained and evaluated on a modification of a dataset from Dialogue State Tracking
Challenge 2 `[2] <#references>`__. The modifications were as follows:

-  **new turns with api calls**

   -  added api\_calls to restaurant database (example:
      ``{"text": "api_call area=\"south\" food=\"dontcare\" pricerange=\"cheap\"", "dialog_acts": ["api_call"]}``)

-  **new actions**

   -  bot dialog actions were concatenated into one action (example:
      ``{"dialog_acts": ["ask", "request"]}`` ->
      ``{"dialog_acts": ["ask_request"]}``)
   -  if a slot key was associated with the dialog action, the new act
      was a concatenation of an act and a slot key (example:
      ``{"dialog_acts": ["ask"], "slot_vals": ["area"]}`` ->
      ``{"dialog_acts": ["ask_area"]}``)

-  **new train/dev/test split**

   -  original dstc2 consisted of three different MDP polices, the original train and dev datasets (consisting of
      two polices) were merged and randomly split into train/dev/test

-  **minor fixes**

   -  fixed several dialogs, where actions were wrongly annotated
   -  uppercased first letter of bot responses
   -  unified punctuation for bot responses

Your data
^^^^^^^^^

Dialogs
'''''''

If your model uses DSTC2 and relies on ``dstc2_v2_reader`` (``DSTC2Version2DatasetReader``), all needed files, if not
present in the ``dataset_reader.data_path`` directory, will be downloaded from internet.

If your model needs to be trained on different data, you have several ways of achieving that (sorted by increase
in the amount of code):

1. Use ``"dialog_iterator"`` in dataset iterator config section and ``"dstc2_v2_reader"`` in dataset reader config
   section (**the simplest, but not the best way**):

   -  set ``dataset_iterator.data_path`` to your data directory;
   -  your data files should have the same format as expected in
      ``deeppavlov.dataset_readers.dstc2_reader:DSTC2Version2DatasetReader.read()`` function.


2. Use ``"dialog_iterator"`` in dataset iterator config section and ``"your_dataset_reader"`` in dataset reader config
   section (**recommended**):

   -  clone ``deeppavlov.dataset_readers.dstc2_reader:DSTC2Version2DatasetReader`` to ``YourDatasetReader``;
   -  register as ``"your_dataset_reader"``;
   -  rewrite so that it implements the same interface as the origin. Particularly, ``YourDatasetReader.read()`` must
      have the same output as ``DSTC2DatasetReader.read()``:
   -  ``train`` — training dialog turns consisting of tuples:

      -  first tuple element contains first user's utterance info (as dict with the following fields):

         -  ``text`` — utterance string
         -  ``intents`` — list of string intents, associated with user's utterance
         -  ``db_result`` — a database response *(optional)*
         -  ``episode_done`` — set to ``true``, if current utterance is the start of a new dialog, and ``false``
            (or skipped) otherwise *(optional)*

      -  second tuple element contains second user's response info

         -  ``text`` — utterance string
         -  ``act`` — an act, associated with the user's utterance

   -  ``valid`` — validation dialog turns in the same format
   -  ``test`` — test dialog turns in the same format


3. Use your own dataset iterator and dataset reader (**if 2. doesn't work for you**):

   -  your ``YourDatasetIterator.gen_batches()`` class method output should match the input format for chainer from
      ``configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2.json``.

Templates
'''''''''

You should provide a maping from actions to text templates in the following format (and set ``template_type`` to
``"BaseTemplate"``, DSTC2 uses an extension of templates –``"DualTemplate"``, you will probably not need it):
``action_template``, where filled slots in templates should start with "#" and mustn't contain whitespaces.

For example,

.. code:: bash

    bye You are welcome!
    canthear  Sorry, I can't hear you.
    expl-conf_area  Did you say you are looking for a restaurant in the #area of town?
    inform_area+inform_food+offer_name  #name is a nice place in the #area of town serving tasty #food food.

Database (optional)
'''''''''''''''''''

If your dataset doesn't imply any api calls to an external database, just do not set ``database`` and
``api_call_action`` parameters and skip the section below.

Otherwise, you should specify them and

1. provide sql table with requested items or
2. construct such table from provided in train samples ``db_result`` items. This can be done with the following script:


.. code:: bash

    cd deeppavlov
    python3 deep.py train configs/go_bot/database_yourdataset.json

where ``configs/go_bot/database_yourdataset.json`` is a copy of ``configs/go_bot/database_dstc2.json`` with configured
``save_path``, ``primary_keys`` and ``unknown_value``.
